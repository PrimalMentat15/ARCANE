# Generative Agents (Private Refactor)

This is a private repository containing a refactored version of the original [Generative Agents](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents) research project by Stanford and Google researchers.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to refactor and customize the original simulation infrastructure for specific research and development needs. This version focuses on improving the code structure and integrating custom modules while maintaining the core agentic capabilities described in the original paper.

To set up your environment, you will need to generate a `utils.py` file that contains your OpenAI API key and download the necessary packages.

### Step 1. Generate Utils File
In the `reverie/backend_server` folder (where `reverie.py` is located), create a new file titled `utils.py` and copy and paste the content below into the file:
```python
# Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = "<Your OpenAI API>"
# Put your name
key_owner = "<Name>"

maze_assets_loc = "../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets"
env_matrix = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix"
env_visuals = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals"

fs_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/storage"
fs_temp_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage"

collision_block_id = "32125"

# Verbose 
debug = True
```
Replace `<Your OpenAI API>` with your OpenAI API key, and `<name>` with your name.
 
### Step 2. Install requirements.txt
Install everything listed in the `requirements.txt` file (I strongly recommend first setting up a virtualenv as usual). A note on Python version: we tested our environment on Python 3.9.12.

To run a new simulation, you will need to concurrently start two servers: the environment server and the agent simulation server.

### Step 1. Starting the Environment Server
Again, the environment is implemented as a Django project, and as such, you will need to start the Django server. To do this, first navigate to `environment/frontend_server` (this is where `manage.py` is located) in your command line. Then run the following command:

    python manage.py runserver

Then, on your favorite browser, go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). If you see a message that says, "Your environment server is up and running," your server is running properly. Ensure that the environment server continues to run while you are running the simulation, so keep this command-line tab open!

### Step 2. Starting the Simulation Server
Open up another command line (the one you used in Step 1 should still be running the environment server, so leave that as it is). Navigate to `reverie/backend_server` and run `reverie.py`.

    python reverie.py
This will start the simulation server. A command-line prompt will appear, asking the following: "Enter the name of the forked simulation: ". To start a 3-agent simulation with Isabella Rodriguez, Maria Lopez, and Klaus Mueller, type the following:
    
    base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus
The prompt will then ask, "Enter the name of the new simulation: ". Type any name to denote your current simulation (e.g., just "test-simulation" will do for now).

    test-simulation
Keep the simulator server running. At this stage, it will display the following prompt: "Enter option: "

### Step 3. Running and Saving the Simulation
On your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8000/simulator_home](http://localhost:8000/simulator_home). You should see the map of Smallville, along with a list of active agents on the map. You can move around the map using your keyboard arrows. Please keep this tab open. To run the simulation, type the following command in your simulation server in response to the prompt, "Enter option":

    run <step-count>
Note that you will want to replace `<step-count>` above with an integer indicating the number of game steps you want to simulate. For instance, if you want to simulate 100 game steps, you should input `run 100`. One game step represents 10 seconds in the game.

Once the simulation finishes running, the "Enter option" prompt will re-appear. At this point, you can simulate more steps by re-entering the run command with your desired game steps, exit the simulation without saving by typing `exit`, or save and exit by typing `fin`.

### Step 4. Replaying a Simulation
You can replay a simulation that you have already run simply by having your environment server running and navigating to the following address in your browser: `http://localhost:8000/replay/<simulation-name>/<starting-time-step>`.

### Step 5. Demoing a Simulation
To properly demonstrate a simulation with appropriate character sprites, you will need to compress the simulation first. Execute the `compress` function in `compress_sim_storage.py` with the name of the target simulation as its input.

To start the demo, go to: `http://localhost:8000/demo/<simulation-name>/<starting-time-step>/<simulation-speed>`.

All simulations that you save will be located in `environment/frontend_server/storage`, and all compressed demos will be located in `environment/frontend_server/compressed_storage`. 

## <img src="https://joonsungpark.s3.amazonaws.com:443/static/assets/characters/profile/Sam_Moore.png" alt="Generative Sam">   Customization
There are two ways to optionally customize your simulations. 

### Author and Load Agent History
1. Start your simulation using one of the base simulations (`base_the_ville_n25` or `base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus`).
2. When prompted with "Enter option: ", load the agent history:
   `call -- load history the_ville/<history_file_name>.csv`

### Create New Base Simulations
The most straightforward approach would be to copy and paste an existing base simulation folder, renaming and editing it according to your requirements.
