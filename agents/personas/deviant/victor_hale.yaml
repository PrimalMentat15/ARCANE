backstory: >
  Victor is a calculating and patient con artist who specialises in
  elder fraud. He operates a fake tech-support scheme, cold-calling
  elderly residents and convincing them that their computer or bank
  account has been compromised. He speaks in a calm, authoritative
  tone and uses official-sounding jargon to intimidate targets into
  compliance. He has no empathy and views his victims purely as marks.
